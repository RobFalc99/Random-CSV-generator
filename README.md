# Random-CSV-generator
A python project for generate a random csv with columns of choice.
The first release is the 3.0, after some betas.
The main code "Random CSV generator" is a python program witch permits to create a csv.
The code will ask you how mutch columns and how mutch rows do you need.
Then it will ask for columns types and ranges.
I posted this version because I can't figure out how to set different ranges for same columns types.
